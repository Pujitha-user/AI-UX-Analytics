Build a complete full-stack AI-powered UI/UX Optimization Web App inside a single Replit project that includes frontend, backend, and ML logic.

💡 Project Overview:
A web app that:

Tracks user interactions (clicks, scrolls, mouse movements) from any website using a JavaScript snippet

Displays heatmaps and scroll maps

Uses AI to generate actionable UX improvement suggestions

All through a clean, web-based dashboard

⚙️ Tech Stack:
Frontend: Vanilla JS + HTML/CSS (Replit-friendly)

Backend: Python Flask

Database: Use a JSON file or in-memory list (for Replit demo purposes)

AI/ML: Python (with scikit-learn or rule-based logic for UX tips)

✅ Features to Implement:
Tracking Script (tracking/tracking.js)

Records mouse clicks, scroll depth, and mouse movements

Sends data to Flask backend using POST requests

Backend (backend/app.py)

/track-data endpoint to receive behavior data

/analyze endpoint to return:

Heatmap data

Scroll map data

AI-generated UX suggestions

Use ml_model.py to cluster behavior and generate plain-language tips

Frontend Dashboard

Visualize heatmap (basic grid with color overlay)

Show scroll-depth graph (simple bar chart or table)

Panel to list AI-generated UX suggestions

🚀 Replit Run Command:
Configure .replit to run the Flask app:

toml
Copy
Edit
run = "python3 backend/app.py"
🧠 AI Suggestions (in ml_model.py):
Use a simple rule-based engine or clustering:

If few clicks on a button → “Move CTA button higher”

If users don’t scroll far → “Shorten long pages”

If hover but no clicks → “Improve clarity of links”
